** QUALTRICSXM
Drupal Qualtrics integration module

* INTRODUCTION
Provide easy access to your Qualtrics surveys on your Drupal or govCMS site.

This module adds a new "QualtricsXM Survey Embed Field" that Drupal users can on
pages to embed surveys and forms that resize automatically as site visitors
provide their responses. Collecting responses via Qualtrics makes it a lot
easier to analyse than using native Drupal forms functionality.

You will need to create a Qualtrics account and API token to make use of this
module. We're keen to hear from you so please reach out if you have thoughts
and ideas.

* DESCRIPTION:
Make it super-easy to select and render Qualtrics surveys/forms into Drupal
pages.

* REQUIREMENTS:
You will need a Qualtrics account and you will need to generate an API token.
See www.qualtrics.com/support/integrations/api-integration/overview/ for
details.

* INSTALLATION:
Once the module has been copied to your modules directory log in as
administrator and navigate to the Modules area. Turn _on_ both QualtricsXM
modules (qualtricsxm and qualtricsxm_embed). That's all there's to it! Next
follow the configuration instructions below to enter your Qualtrics API token
and create one or more _Content Types_ that your content authors can use to
embed surveys in their pages.
